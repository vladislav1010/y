> An important thing to keep in mind when testing is simplifying the maintenance of the tests by reducing the amount of unrelated cruft in the test. You want to make it so the code for the test communicates what's important and what is not important.

> Inter-system communications are a different matter. Unlike collaborations between classes inside your application, the way your system talks to the external world forms the observable behavior of that system as a whole. Itâ€™s part of the contract your application must hold at all times
> This attribute of inter-system communications stems from the way separate applications evolve together. One of the main principles of such an evolution is maintaining backward compatibility. Regardless of the refactorings you perform inside your system, the communication pattern it uses to talk to external applications should always stay in place, so that external applications can understand it.
